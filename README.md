# Cogsworth
Discord Bot named Cogsworth for Cognition Corp. based off of Sorrien's DiscordBot using Discord.Net

Setup:
You will have to follow the first few steps of this guide:
https://discord.foxbot.me/docs/guides/introduction/intro.html

Just so you can get the discord side of the bot all ready to go. Take your authentication token and place it in the authentication.json file. Commands can be added in commands.json

Mentioning the bot in discord should trigger a response from the chat bot side of the application. The bot can only learn from the users that is speaks to. (word filters TBA) At first it will be rather simple, just the more it talks to people the better it will become at conversation.
